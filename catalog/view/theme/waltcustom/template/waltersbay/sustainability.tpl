        Walters Bay recognizes that our tea estate workers and growers need access to basic services. In the absence of these services,
        <br>
        healthy communities cannot flourish.
        <br>
        <br>
        There are five main components to our social sustainability initiative:
    </p>
    <ul class="text">
        <li> Education: Mandatory school attendance for all children. </li>
        <li> Day Care Centers: Provided for children before they reach school age. </li>
        <li> Housing: Subsidized housing for tea estate workers and their families.</li>
        <li> Healthcare: Free medical clinics for estate workers and their families. </li>
        <li> Retirement: Retirement programs provided for all workers. </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para" align="center">
        Our commitment to the environment—to the lands on which we grow our teas—is as strong as our commitment to our workers. From natural forms of pest control to hand-plucking tea leaves, Walters Bay ensures our teas are grown, processed, and distributed in a sustainable manner.

            <b> Hand-Plucking Tea Leaves: </b>
            <br>
            All of our tea leaves are hand-plucked in order to:
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li>Ensure tea quality.</li>
                <li>Eliminate carbon emissions from mechanized harvesters.</li>
                <li>Monitor and remove any imperfect leaves, as well as any harmful insects and pests.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <b> Soil Maintenance: </b>
            <br>
            We maintain our soils by using grass varieties in our fields to control erosion.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <b> Limited-use of pesticides: </b>
            <br>
            Minimal use of pesticides helps to sustain the ecological balance of the tea fields.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            <b> Energy Efficiency: </b>
            <br>
            We constantly improve energy efficiency in our processing plants to reduce carbon emissions.
        </li>
